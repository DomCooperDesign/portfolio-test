A starter kit for static portfolio sites. Lightweight, customisable, open source. It is geared towards designers, illustrators, architects, all sorts of individuals who are interested in sharing images of their work and news / posts online. It isn’t quite ready yet but will be available soon.

The intended user may not know any code but is interested in the tech underlying their website, is willing to write in Markdown, and is happy to follow a tutorial or two. It can be used as-is and deployed without touching any code, or it can be used as a jumping off point for further customisation if you’re willing to get your hands dirty with a little HTML and CSS.
