WIP

This is a lightweight static portfolio starterkit built with Eleventy and hosted on Netlify. It’s is geared towards designers, illustrators, architects, all sorts of individuals who are interested in sharing images of their work and news / posts online.

The intended user may not know any code but is interested in the tech underlying their website, is willing to write in Markdown, and is happy to follow a tutorial or two. It can be used as-is and deployed without touching any code, or it can be used as a jumping off point for further customisation if you’re willing to get your hands dirty with a little HTML and CSS.

## Features

- No-code setup
- Static files generated by [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), meaning it’s _fast_
- [TODO note about free static hosting]
- [TODO Note about accessibility]
- Supports projects and posts (news, blog, etc.)

## Restrictions

TODO

- Can only support up to [todo] images
- Browser support
- Updates have to be done manually

## Suggested extensions

- Hook up to AirTable
- Forestry CMS

## Getting Started

There are two ways to publish a website with this template depending on your technical skillset. Go down the [no-code setup](#) route if you’re not a developer or don’t want to deal with code. Go down the [advanced setup](#) route if you’re happy with `npm` and the command line.

### No-code setup

You don’t need to be a developer to get this site set up. All you need is a GitHub account, a Netlify account, and the ability to follow some instructions.

#### 1. Get a GitHub account

GitHub is a platform that stores code. Your website code and content are going to live on GitHub. If you have an account already, go ahead and log in. If not, sign up for an account. The free individual account is sufficient.

#### 2. Get a Netlify account

Netlify is a hosting provider that offers a generous free tier for people with static websites like this one. If you have a Netlify account, log in. If you don’t, sign up for one. It is _highly_ recommended that you use your GitHub account to sign up / in because it will make the Netlify CMS setup a lot simpler.

#### 3. Deploy this website

Click the button below to deploy this website to Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sb-ph/portfolio-2020)

What this does is fork this repository, creating a duplicate version associated with your own GitHub account, and then it deploys your version to Netlify.

When you click the button, you’ll be asked to connect to GitHub. Go ahead and do that.

TODO add more info about what this does, how to find their site in Netlify

#### 4. Configure your site

To customize the site-wide information such as the footer text or the site title, edit `src/data/global.json`.

#### 5. Hook up your domain
