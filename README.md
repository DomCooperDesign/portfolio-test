## Getting Started

There are two ways to publish a website with this template depending on your technical skillset. Go down the [no-code setup](#) route if you’re not a developer or don’t want to deal with code. Go down the [advanced setup](#) route if you’re happy with `npm` and the command line.

### No-code setup

You don’t need to be a developer to get this site set up. All you need is a GitHub account, a Netlify account, and the ability to follow some instructions.

#### 1. Get a GitHub account

GitHub is a platform that stores code. Your website code and content are going to live on GitHub. If you have an account already, go ahead and log in. If not, sign up for an account. The free individual account is sufficient.

#### 2. Get a Netlify account

Netlify is a hosting provider that offers a generous free tier for people with static websites like this one. If you have a Netlify account, log in. If you don’t, sign up for one. It is _highly_ recommended that you use your GitHub account to sign up / in because it will make the Netlify CMS setup a lot simpler.

#### 3. Deploy this website

Click the button below to deploy this website to Netlify.

[![Deploy to Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/img/deploy/button.svg)](https://app.netlify.com/start/deploy?repository=https://github.com/sb-ph/portfolio-2020)

What this does is fork this repository, creating a duplicate version associated with your own GitHub account, and then it deploys your version to Netlify.

When you click the button, you’ll be asked to connect to GitHub. Go ahead and do that.

#### 4. Configure your site

The easiest way to go live is by forking this repo and deploying it to Netlify.
You can do that by clicking this button:

To customize the site, edit `src/data/meta.json` with your details, and replace the markdown files in `src/posts` with your content.

#### 5. Hook up your domain

## Advanced setup

### Local Development

To run this locally, you need to install Node first. Once Node is installed, you can run these on the command line in the root of your project:

- `npm start`: starts development server
- `npm run build`: generates a production build
- `npm run debug`: runs eleventy with debug output

To customize the site, edit `src/data/meta.js` with your details, or set the corresponding environment variables in a new `.env` file in the root folder of the project.

## Extending the site

You’re welcome to tinker and extend your website however you please. If you’re interested in our help, just get in touch and we’ll discuss options.

## Colophon

The docs are inspired by [Max Boeck’s Emergency Site](https://github.com/maxboeck/emergency-site).
